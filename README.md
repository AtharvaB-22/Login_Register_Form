# Login_Register_Form
A website to allow users to login or register. 

I have used HTML and CSS on this website to develop the login and registration pages. 
Apart from these, I even have a home page to connect these two pages to the database.

I have used NodeJs and ExpressJs technologies to develop the backend to authenticate the forms and connect them to the local database.
I have developed the database by MongoDB. 

In this mini project, I have ensured the authentication of user passwords by validating the credentials with our database.
I have used password hashing and encryption to enhance security, making the user data safe.
